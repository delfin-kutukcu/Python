# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Contents

1. **Inheritance (`1_inheritance.py`)**
   - Demonstrates how child classes inherit attributes and methods from parent classes.
   - Example of single and multiple inheritance.
   
2. **Method Overriding (`2_Method_Overriding.py`)**
   - Shows how a subclass can redefine a method from its superclass.
   - Useful for modifying or extending functionality.
   
3. **Encapsulation (`3_Encapsulation.py`)**
   - Explains how to protect class attributes using private and protected access modifiers.
   - Demonstrates getter and setter methods.
   
4. **Polymorphism (`4_Polymorphism.py`)**
   - Illustrates method overloading and method overriding.
   - Explains the importance of code reusability and flexibility.
   
5. **Abstraction (`5_Abstraction.py`)**
   - Introduces abstract classes and methods using Python’s `ABC` module.
   - Helps in defining a blueprint for other classes.
   
## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended). You can run each script separately using the command:

```sh
python filename.py
```

For example, to run the inheritance example:

```sh
python 1_inheritance.py
```
