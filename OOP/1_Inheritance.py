This file demonstrates the concept of inheritance in Python.
It explains multiple inheritance and the built-in `object` class.

# The base class from which all other classes inherit

    Base class for all animals. Defines common properties and behaviors.

        #***************************************

        #__init__ :
        The __init__ method is called when an instance of the class is created.
        It initializes the object's attributes with the values provided during instantiation.
        These attributes are specific to the instance (object) and can be modified later.


        Example:
        pegasus_animal = Animal('Pegasus', 4)
        Here, 'Pegasus' and 4 are the name and number_of_feet attributes of the pegasus_animal object.
        These attributes are assigned to the object during runtime.
